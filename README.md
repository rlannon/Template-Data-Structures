# Template Data Structures
 A library implementing various common data structures with C++ templates.
 
## Goal
 The goal of this project is to learn how to use C++ templates effectively (especially alongisde other object-oriented concepts_, and is not meant to be an optimized implementation of such data structures.

## Getting Started
 These are header-only and can be used when included in a project. They each implement a variety of methods, and because they are header-only, should support any class for ```<class T>```.

### Portability
 This project has only been compiled on MSVC and run on Windows 10. Clang and GCC have not been tested and so may have issues.
