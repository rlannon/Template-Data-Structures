# Template Data Structures
A library implementing various algorithms data structures with C++ templates.
 
## Goal
The goal of this project is to learn how to use C++ templates effectively (especially alongisde other object-oriented concepts_, and is not meant to be an optimized implementation of such data structures. Many of the implemented algorithms and structures will be those commonly taught in an algorithms/data structures course, such as sorting algorithms, stacks, queues, trees, etc..

## Getting Started
These are header-only and can be used when included in a project with no additional steps.

### Supported types and classes
All data structures should support any ```<typename T>```.

Algorithms will support any class or type for which the equality/inequality operators are defined.

### Portability
This project has only been compiled on MSVC and run on Windows 10. Clang and GCC have not been tested and so may have issues.
